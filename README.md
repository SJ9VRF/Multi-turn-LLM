## Technical Review of LLM Fine-Tuning for Multi-Turn Conversations

This document provides a technical overview of the processes involved in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations. The project is structured into four main components: Dataset Preparation, Fine-Tuning Management, Model Evaluation, and Infrastructure & Utilities.

### 1. Dataset Preparation

**Objective:** Prepare a conversational dataset that effectively trains LLMs to understand and maintain context over multiple conversational turns.

#### Process:

- **Data Loading:** Utilize the `datasets` library to load structured conversational datasets such as CoQA, which contains context-based questions and answers.
- **Data Mapping:** Transform dialogues into a structured JSONL format where each message is tagged with a role (`system`, `user`, or `assistant`) and content. Include a system prompt at the start to establish context.
- **Data Serialization:** Convert the mapped data into JSONL files, suitable for machine learning frameworks and APIs, ensuring efficiency in handling large datasets.

### 2. Fine-Tuning Management

**Objective:** Configure and manage the fine-tuning process to enhance the LLM's capability in handling multi-turn conversations.

#### Process:

- **API Setup:** Initialize a connection to a fine-tuning API (e.g., Together API), configuring API keys and client setups.
- **Dataset Upload:** Upload the prepared dataset to the platform, ensuring it passes all format and usability checks.
- **Job Configuration:** Set parameters such as model selection (e.g., Meta-Llama-8B), epochs, learning rate, and advanced techniques like LoRA for efficient training.
- **Job Execution:** Start the fine-tuning process, monitor its progress, and adjust parameters as necessary based on real-time feedback.

### 3. Model Evaluation

**Objective:** Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance in multi-turn conversation scenarios.

#### Process:

- **Answer Generation:** Use the model to generate answers for validation data to assess its context-maintenance ability over multiple turns.
- **Metrics Calculation:** Apply metrics like F1 score and Exact Match (EM) to evaluate the model's accuracy and relevance in response generation.
- **Performance Analysis:** Analyze results to determine the model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding further iterations of training and refinement.

### 4. Infrastructure and Utilities

**Objective:** Ensure robust infrastructure and helpful utilities for effective project execution.

#### Process:

- **Dependency Management:** Manage Python dependencies using `requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manage API keys and sensitive data using `python-dotenv`, avoiding hard-coded values.
- **Parallel Processing:** Implement threading or multiprocessing to enhance efficiency in data processing and model evaluations, crucial for handling large datasets and computation-intensive tasks.
